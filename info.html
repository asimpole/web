          <a id="text1" style="display: -webkit-box; -webkit-line-clamp: 3; -webkit-box-orient: vertical;  overflow: hidden;">The club was founded in 1925 at a time when there were only two other clubs in Norfolk: Norwich and Lowestoft Yarmouth. The club was initially based in Swaffham, moving to King’s Lynn in the 1930’s and based at the Dukes Head Hotel until the outbreak of the war.

            The club reformed after the hostilities and began its association with North Wootton. Initially making its home at the Red Cat Hotel using the stables for its changing facilities, the original pitch was some distance from the hotel out on the marshes.
            
            By the early sixties the club was running two sides regularly and the need for a dedicated clubhouse and ground became more apparent. The present ground comprising of approximately ten acres of land and a layout containing three full size pitches, was acquired in 1965. After draining and seeding the playing facility came into use in 1969 with the initial prefabricated clubhouse coming into use in 1970.
            
            During the seventies and early eighties the club saw significant development on the playing side with the senior side of the club expanding to three regular sides and a strong veteran’s team. During this period West Norfolk was the first side to successfully develop and run an under 19 Colts team. The latter part of the eighties and throughout the nineties has seen sustained growth of all rugby sections with the club developing a strong mini and youth policy resulting in representative sides at all age groups from under 7’s through to under 19’s.
            
            The continued expansion and success of both senior and more significantly junior and mini rugby during the latter part of the eighties has meant that the original clubhouse and facilities became inadequate. This lead to the last major building project to develop the clubhouse and improve both the changing and medical facilities. The project started in 1989 and was completed in 1992.
            
            Over recent years the club has continued to prosper and develop, and has achieved the Rugby Football Union’s Club Accreditation for a third time.
            
            The West Norfolk ethos is to welcome current, past and new members alike – whether you want to learn, play, or just watch and talk rugby, West Norfolk is the club for you!</a>
